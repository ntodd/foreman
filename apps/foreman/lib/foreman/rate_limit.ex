  In-memory rate limits for sign-in, enrollment and agent connects.

  Agent connects and enrollment count failures only (`exhausted?/3`
  before the attempt, `failed/3` after a failed one), so a client sending
  junk uses up its own allowance and never a correctly signed agent's.
  Keys use the real client address (`ForemanWeb.ClientIP`).
