  Reloads a page whose CSS and JavaScript predate the running release.

  A tab left open across a deploy reconnects to the new server and gets
  new markup, but keeps the stylesheet and scripts it loaded first, so
  anything that changed in both renders wrong until a hard refresh. The
  root layout tracks those assets (`phx-track-static`); when they've
  changed, the page reloads at the same URL instead.
